            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSAL FOR Advancing of TRADE, and supporting the POOR.</head>
            <p>THE Dearth of Victual at Home and Abroad, and the Scarcity of Money at Home, will cause the Cess. Customes, Excise, and other Funds (necessary for support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government and Army) undoubtedly fail, and occasion a Famine and great Death among the People.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>For preventing of this, The following Overtures may be considered.</head>
               <p>THE Burrows to make Bank-notes, to the Value of Three Hundered Thousand Pound <hi>Starling,</hi> from one Shilling <hi>Starling</hi> to one Hundered Pound <hi>Starling:</hi> These to be divided amongst the Royal Burrows, according to their Taxt-roll of Ninety Pound already made. And amongst the Unfree Burghs, who shall take the Benefit of the Communication of Trade, according to their Taxt-roll of Ten Pound to be made.</p>
               <p>Every Town to give sufficient Security to the Mannagers of the Burrow-Bank, for their Proportion of the Bank-Money, and to take Security from the Respective Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, conform to their Sent-rolls.</p>
               <p>Every Town to receive four fifth parts in Bank-Money, and one fifth part in a Joynt Stock of Trade.</p>
               <p>Each of the saids Burghs, to pay in yearly in Bank-Notes to the Managers of the Bank, the tenth part of their Share, and the saids Mannagers to be careful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the same, so that at the end of the ten Years, the Bank-notes are all destroyed, and the Burghs Disburdened.</p>
               <p>All the Burgesses and other Inhabitants of the saids Burghs (who bear burden with the Town) shall be obliged to take the saids Bank-notes, in payment of their Merchant Goods, Ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in case the Contravention be without the Jurisdiction of a Burgh, the Dilation is to be made to the Mannagers; And the one half of the Fyne to belong to the Dilator, as said is, and the other half to the Mannagers: And in both Cases, the Contraveener to be Imprisoned till the Fyne be payed.</p>
               <p>For Encouraging and carrying on of Trade, and preventing tedious Law Sutes anent the Bank-Money, and I rade to be carryed on by the same, the Magistrate of the Burgh is to determine all Controversies, with all convenient Diligence: And if any of the Parties shall not acquiesce in the Sentence of the Magistrat, then the Party not acquiesc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may cite the other Party to Answer before the Mannagers within fifteen Dayes; And the Mannagers are to decern with all Diligence. And in case the Defender be Assoilʒied, the Pursuer to be decerned not only in the Damnages done to the Defender, but in a Fyne to the Mannagers, to be Modified by the Mannagers themselves.</p>
               <p>The seting up and carrying on a Trade in SCOTLAND (which would be found as fit for Trade as any Nation, considering their Lands and Seas that are to be Improven, the multitude of People innured to hard Labour, and a mean way of Living, Active and Industrious in Bussiness) a Stock for the same, Directions for improving the Stock, and Mannagers for executing the Directions are necessary.</p>
               <p>It will be fit that the Burrows name five Persons of the greatest Skill and Application, to mannage the Trust.</p>
               <p>They are to Trade with the fifth part of the foresaid Summ, <hi>Viz:</hi> Sixty Thousand pound <hi>Starling,</hi> at Home and Abroad, to the best Advantage, and to give an account to the General Convention in <hi>July</hi> yearly of their Traffique, with the said Summ, and the Success thereof.</p>
               <p>They are to receive Overtures from all the Burghs who shall offer the same, and to Record the saids Overtu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They are to make choice of fit and necessary Servants for serving in the Bank, Trade, and Correspondence, and to give them suteable Allowance, and to be careful to make good Choice, and a competent Reward.</p>
               <p>They are to have allowed them, all their Expences debursed in carrying on the Trade, with the Servants Wages, and a Pension of Two Hundered pound <hi>Starling</hi> to each of them for their yearly Sallarie, and a Pension of Two Hundered pound <hi>Starling</hi> yearly to the Assessor of the Royal Burrows, who is to have a joynt Vote with them in their Mannagement, and in Actions that shall be brought before them: And the Sallaries, Wages, and Expences, are to be payed out of the neat Profit of the General joynt Stock allenerly.</p>
